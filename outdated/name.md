# NAME stands for

NAME is a simple naming convention that works

1. *N*o space. The name should not have space. 
2. *A*ll small cap. The name should be all small cap.
3. *M*eaningful words. The name should be meaningful english word first. 
4. *E*xplain what it is or what it does. The name should explains.

## Regarding #1, removing space by following these rules: 

- For directories, files or repo name, use hyphen ·†Ü
- For variables, use underscore 
- For classes, use CamelBack üê´
  

## Other rules for naming 

1. Clarity is always more important than conciseness. For example, consider a function that check true or false, i will use `check_true_or_false` as the function name over `check_truth` or `check_truthy`

2. The less important a variable/method name, the more concise it should be. 

For example, i will use `i` over `index` for an index. The reason is because `i` is not that important.
