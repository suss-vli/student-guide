# NAME stands for

NAME is a simple naming convention that works

1. *N*o space. The name should not have space. 
2. *A*ll small cap. The name should be all small cap.
3. *M*eaningful words. The name should be meaningful english word first. 
4. *E*xplain what it is or what it does. The name should explains.

## Regarding #1, removing space by following these rules: 

- For directories, files or repo name, use hyphen ·†Ü
- For variables, use underscore 
- For classes, use CamelBack üê´
  

## Other rules for naming 

1. Clarity is always more important than conciseness. For example, consider a function that check true or false, i will use `check_true_or_false` as the function name over `check_truth` or `check_truthy`

2. The less important a variable/method name, the more concise it should be. 

For example, i will use `i` over `index` for an index. The reason is because `i` is not that important. 

3. Underscore is always clearer than camelBack in my opinion. 

4. `each_item` in a list is better than `e` or `each`. This may be a matter of taste instead of clarity. 

5. `course_name_for_january_lab` is always better than `course_name_4_january_lab`. ALWAYS.



## Other other rules 

Names are related to context and context is related to the actual problem. Thus, programmers who are not the actual problem solver will find it hard to give a good name. 
When the problem changes, the context changes. The name should be updated to make the code readable
