# **IT SUPPORT**

Should you have any query or issues encountered, please use the
discussion forum in Canvas for clarification. Alternatively, you may
contact the administrator via email at <vlisupport@suss.edu.sg> for
further support.

# **IMPORTANT POINTS TO TAKE NOTE (if applicable to your course)**

a.  Students' final version of solution code are required to be zipped
    and deposited in the submission folder. For those who choose to
    develop their work locally, they would be responsible themselves for
    issues encountered in the local platform and to perform by uploading
    their files to the default Vocareum platform so that instructor can
    unzip it and run the source code.

b.  The solution code will ONLY be accepted on Vocareum when the Word
    Document report for Turnitin is also submitted. Otherwise, it will
    be considered as invalid.
